            Donzelli is a new Italian furniture brand founded by an Italian designer in 2021, to help people create the
            best version
            of their work, living and personal space to ensure their fulfillment.

            This project & client was executed in 2021 when I founded my own consulting company.

                The luxury designer furniture market is facing a huge customer experience issue. The majority of
                companies operating in
                this field are either distributors, manufacturers or have the rights to publish designer pieces. They
                survive solely
                through their products and the prestige of their products, which they sometimes do not even own, without
                offering a true
                360° brand experience. Few brands on the market embody a true essence beyond the products, and forget to
                capture the
                desires and needs of their customers. And these days, relying on a great story does not create a true
                global experience.

            How do you create an experience that goes beyond the products and their story, to allow people to design the
            environment

            <div class="listofcontent mediumtext">
                Donzelli was one of my clients when I was self-employed before joining Emakina. First of all, the idea
                was to understand
                the high-end furniture market in order to position the brand on which niche it could be positioned.
                Depending on its
                expertise, its heritage and its competitors. To overcome the lack of customer experience on the market,
                it was necessary
                to think and design an online experience that is similar to that of a store, but even more advanced.
                Donzelli has become
                the first furniture design index in the world to offer all furniture pieces on a single platform, all
                brands included.
                By offering a range of furniture covering the largest distributors and publishers : <br> <br>

                Vitra, Cassina, B&B, Flos, Knoll, BoConcept, Rochebobois ... <br> <br>

                We had the opportunity to create different spaces and rooms to project the customer into a universe,
                adding a selection
                of products to achieve consistency of the pieces chosen online on the digital experience. <br> <br>

                A solution supported by augmented reality to arrange a selection of furniture within a space. Donzelli
                is also equipped
                with its experience and expertise in design and architecture by proposing pieces of furniture that match
                together but
                also spaces and environments already designed so that in a few clicks you can order your custom or well
                designed entire
                interior on a single platform.
